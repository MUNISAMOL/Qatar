            As the largest mosque in Qatar, Imam Abdul Wahhab, also known as the Qatar State Grand Mosque, was inaugurated in 2011. Its simple lines and graceful arches are nonetheless eye-catching, and characteristic of Islamic architectural tradition. The mosque houses three libraries, separate prayer and ablution halls for men and women, and special halls for Quran memorisation, and can hold over 30,000 worshippers.The sandstone mosque commands impressive views of the Doha skyline, with its succession of arches and domes marking the mosque as the largest in the country.  Earth coloured marble flooring keeps worshippers cool during the heat of summer, while corridors covered by small domes offer shade.  The mosque consists of a total of 93 domes, some of which sit atop the prayer niche or mihrab and the prayer hall.  Religious instruction is offered throughout the year, in addition to a robust calendar of social, educational and cultural programs.
