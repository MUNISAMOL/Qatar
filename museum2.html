Pei's specifications, the museum is built on an island off an artificial projecting peninsula near the traditional dhow harbor.A purpose-built park surrounds the edifice on the eastern and southern facades while two bridges connect the southern front facade of the property with the main peninsula that holds the park.The western and northern facades are marked by the harbor showcasing the Qatari seafaring past.
