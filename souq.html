            Souq Waqif is a marketplace in Doha, in the state of Qatar. The souq sells traditional garments, spices, handicrafts, and souvenirs. It is also home to restaurants and shisha lounges. The original building dates back at least from the 20th Century in a traditional Qatari architectural style. It was renovated in 2006.The souq is considered a tourist attraction within Doha.A yearly spring festival around April hosts many theatricals, acrobatics and musical performances.An event featuring WWE wrestlers, called Souq Waqif Storm, attracted the most spectators. There was discussion over the possibility of a repeat festival.There are pet stalls in Souq Waqif which sell a variety of domestic pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles and birds. The sub-par living conditions of the pets has been the subject of advocacy campaigns in recent years, with proponents arguing that the animals suffer from a lack of proper healthcare and exposure to adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, some customers allege that stall owners falsify vaccination records.There is also a separate area in the souq reserved for falcon handling.The falcon souq, as it's called, sells not only falcons but also the needed accessories such as landing pads and GPS guidance systems for the birds.Within the vicinity is also a Falcon Hospital.
